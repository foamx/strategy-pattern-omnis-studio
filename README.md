I've created a basic Strategy Pattern demo using Omnis Studio 6.0.3.


#### Strategy Pattern Definition

The strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a behavioural software design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. ... defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and. makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

#### Object Oriented Priciples enforced or supported by the Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern enforces and supports the following basic object oriented design principles

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
